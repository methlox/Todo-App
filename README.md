- First, the api was built using ___django rest framework___ and later the ___react___ components were implemented in the frontend application.  
- Both drf and react were run on different ports and were using _Cors Headers_ to communicate data.  
- To combine them as a part of the final step, __build production__ was implemented and django was made aware of those static files in its setting.  
- Finally, a url to the empty path was directed towards the frontend.  
- After both were configured together, we can run them on a single port.  
- A __virtual environment__ was deployed for production.  

## Available scripts

run `npm install` to install the node_modules.  

Activate the virtual environment with `env\scripts\activate`

Download all the requirements via `pip install -r requirements.txt`

Run the server with `python manage.py runserver`
